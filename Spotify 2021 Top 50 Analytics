# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. List songs from the Top 50 that have featured artists.
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name like "%feat%" 

#2. What were the top 10 songs by popularity?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc 
LIMIT 10

#3. Which 10 artists had the most songs on the Top 50 playlist, and what where the artists' average danceability, energy, and tempo?
SELECT count(artist_name),artist_name, avg(danceability), avg(energy), avg(tempo) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) desc
LIMIT 10
