# In this analysis, I explore and query a Digital Media Store's dataset that contains tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Group and count the playlists id by their playlist name and order them in a descending order.
SELECT t.playlistid, p.name, count(t.trackid) AS playlist_count
FROM chinook.playlist_track
    JOIN chinook.playlists p
    ON t.playlistid= p.playlistid
GROUP BY t.playlistid
ORDER BY count(t.trackid) desc;

# After running the query, I learn that playlistid=1 and playlistid=8 are duplicates. 

#2. Find the total sales made per year in descending order
SELECT strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) AS InvoiceYear, SUM(total) AS TotalSum
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2013-12-22'
GROUP BY strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate)
ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC
