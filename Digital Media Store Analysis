#In this project, I explore and query a Digital Media Store's dataset that contains tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT customerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The table should include customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT I.InvoiceId, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry, C.FirstName, C.LastName
FROM chinook.invoices I 
    LEFT JOIN chinook.customers C
    ON I.CustomerId=C.CustomerId
WHERE I.BillingCountry = "Brazil"

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent(full name).
SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
    JOIN chinook.customers cust 
    ON cust.supportrepid=emp.employeeid
    JOIN chinook.invoices inv
    ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.total,
       cust.firstname AS customer_firstname, 
       cust.lastname customer_lastname, 
       cust.country, 
       emp.firstname AS employee_firstname, 
       emp.lastname AS employee_lastname 
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees emp ON cust.supportrepid=emp.employeeid

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate like "2009%"

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tra.name, init.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items init
    JOIN chinook.tracks tra 
    ON init.trackid=tra.trackid

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name, artist name, and invoice line ID.
SELECT i.InvoiceLineId
       t.name as Track,
       ar.name as Artist, 
FROM chinook.tracks t
    JOIN chinook.albums al ON t.albumid=al.albumid
    JOIN chinook.artists ar ON al.artistid=ar.artistid
    JOIN chinook.invoice_items i ON i.trackid=t.trackid

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.name AS 'Track', 
       al.Title AS 'Album', 
       m.Name AS 'Media_type', 
       g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
    JOIN chinook.Albums al ON al.AlbumId=t.AlbumId
    JOIN chinook.media_types m ON m.mediatypeid=t.mediatypeid
    JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.genreid=t.genreid

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname AS 'First Name', e.lastname AS 'Last Name', ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.employeeid= c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.customerid= i.customerid
GROUP BY e.firstname;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname AS 'First Name', e.lastname AS 'Last Name', ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.employeeid= c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.customerid= i.customerid
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) desc;
